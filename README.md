# Overview
This is a collaborated effort with mawinkler and nicgoth   
This sets up:
- an AWS codeCommit registry
- codePipeline
- deploys Trend Micro Cloud One Container Security (C1CS)
- and integrates it in the pipeline.  

Then it will:
- deploy 3 containers and
- scan them for vulnerabilities, malware, sensitive content etc..
- and then push them to the ECR registry

This README.md describes how to deploy the demo environment

Checkout the **howToDemo.md** for demo scenarios

# High level overview of steps (detailed steps in next section)
1. open Cloud9
2. clone this repo
3. enter your configuration settings in `00_define_vars.sh.sample` and save it as `.sh` (make sure it is executable)
4. run ./up.sh to deploy the environment (pipeline, scanner,...)
5. build a sample container and see how it get scanned by Cloud One Container Security (C1CS).  If it has more  vulnerabilities, malware or sensitive content than defined in the threshold, then it will not be pushed to the ECR Registry.
6. increase the security thresholds in buildspec.yaml file (=allow more risk) and rebuild the (vulnerable) container.  It will now be pushed to the ECR registry and deployed on EKS.
7. Run a few exploits against it.  Depending on the settings in Cloud One Application Security (C1AS), they will be blocked.  (for a detailed demo scenario, see **howToDemo.md** )
6. run ./down.sh to tear everything down

# Detailed setup instructions

## Requirements
The AWS region that you work in, on your account, must be able to create a VPC and a Public IP. (there is a soft limit of 5 VPCs per AWS account per AWS region)  <br />
The Cloud Formation Template to build the EKS cluster will crash if those resources cannot be created, <br />
The User account that you will use:
- must have **Programmatic Access** as well as **AWS Management Console Access**
- must have **AdministratorAccess** permissions (AWS console -> Services -> IAM -> Users -> click on the user -> Permissions tab -> If AdministratorAccess is not there, then click on Add permissions and add it; or request the rights from you Admin)  The reason is that the script will not only create an EKS cluster, but also a lot of other things, like VPC, subnets, routetables, roles, IPs,...
- **one "free" VPC "slot"**
  Bij default, there is a soft limit of 5 VPCs per region.  This script must be able to create 1 VPC
- **one "free" Elastic IP "slot"**
  Bij default, there is a soft limit of 5 Elastic IPs per region.  This script must be able to create 1 Elastic IP

- **A license for Cloud One Container Image Security** (aka SmartCheck) If you don't have a license key yet, you can get one here: https://www.trendmicro.com/product_trials/download/index/us/168 <br />
- **CloudOne Application Security Account** If you want to demo the Runtime Protection as well, then you need this account.  You can register for a trial here: https://cloudone.trendmicro.com/_workload_iframe//SignUp.screen  You will need to create a "group" for the MoneyX application.  This will give you a **key** and a **secret** that you can use for TREND_AP_KEY and TREND_AP_SECRET<br />

## Preparation  
1. Setup an AWS Cloud9 development environment
  - use `t2.micro`
  - use `Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS`
  - tag it to your liking (tags are good)
  - use default settings for the rest

<!--0. <not needed?>
Create an AWS Role to allow the EKS worker nodes (EC2 instances) to connect to ECR  
 - AWS Services -> IAM -> Roles -> Create Role
 - Select type of trusted entity: AWS Services
 - Choose a use case: EC2 -> Next: Permissions
 - Assign permission policy : "AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess" -> Next: Tags
 - -> Next Role name: e.g. project_name_EC2_access_to_ECR  
  -->
<!-- 0. Grant the Cloud9 environment Administrator Access <br />
- Click the following deep to create the Role for Cloud9:
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles$new?step=review&commonUseCase=EC2%2BEC2&selectedUseCase=EC2&policies=arn:aws:iam::aws:policy%2FAdministratorAccessâ€©
- Name it Cloud9EC2AdminAccess
- Attach the IAM role Cloud9EC2AdminAccess to the ec2 instance of your Cloud9:
  * In the AWS Console, go to Services -> EC2 -> select the EC2 instance used for this Cloud9 -> Actions -> Instance Settings -> Attach/Replace IAM Role
* Within Cloud9 Preferences -> AWS Settings -> Credentials -> AWS managed temporary credentials -> Disable
-->

2. In Cloud9, disable the `AWS-managed temporary credentials`  
Click on the AWS Cloud9 tab in the Cloud9 menu bar (if you don't see the menu bar as indicated in the screfenshot below, hover the mouse over the top of the window. The menu bar should roll down and become visible) -> Preferences -> scroll down and expand "AWS Settings" -> Credentials -> uncheck "AWS managed temporary credentials"

3. Create credentials for CodeCommit  
CodeCommit requires AWS Key Management Service. If you are using an existing IAM user, make sure there are no policies attached to the user that expressly deny the AWS KMS actions required by CodeCommit. For more information, see AWS KMS and encryption. <br />
- In the AWS console, go to Services and choose IAM, then go to Users, and then click on the IAM user you want to configure for CodeCommit access.<br />
- On the Permissions tab, choose Add Permissions.
- In Grant permissions, choose Attach existing policies directly.<br />
- From the list of policies, select AWSCodeCommitPowerUser or another managed policy for CodeCommit access.<br />
- Click "Next: Review" to review the list of policies to attach to the IAM user.<br />
- If the list is correct, choose Add permissions.

4. Get a trial account for Trend Micro Cloud One Container Security (aka Deep Security Smart Check).  
This will provide pre-runtime scanning of containers.
see: https://github.com/deep-security/smartcheck-helm

5. (optionally) Get a trial account for Trend Micro Cloud One Application Security.  
This will provide runtime protection to the containers.

## 1. Define variables for AWS, Cloud One Container Security and (optionally) for Cloud One Application Security
Open a Cloud9 environment and clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/cvdabbeele/cloudOneOnAWS.git
Copy `00_define_vars.sh.sample` to 00_define_vars.sh

Enter your own configuration variables in the config file


## 2. Deploy the environment

```
$ ./up.sh
```
This will do the following:

1. Create an EKS cluster
![](images/CreatingEksCluster.png)
<br /><br />
2. Install Smart Check with internal registry
![](images/DeployingDSSC.png)
<br /><br />
3. Add the internal Repository plus a demo Repository to Smart Check
![](images/AddRepos.png)
<br /><br />
4. Setup demo pipelines
![](images/CreatingPipelines.png)
<br /><br />
5. Deploy 3 demo applications
![](images/CreatingPipelines.png)
<br /><br />
If you encounter any **errors**, please check the "common issues" section at the bottom


## 3. This script will deploy 3 demo applications

At the same level as the project directory (cloudOneOnAWS), an "apps" directory will be created.
Hereunder, 3 apps will be installed (**c1appsecmoneyx, troopers and mydvwa**) <br />
This will trigger an AWS codeCommit process to build and scan those applications by SmartCheck

By default:
- the **troopers** app will be deployed because it is clean
- the **c1-app-sec-moneyx and the mydvwa apps will not be deployed** because they have too many vulnerabilities

### Demo Scenario##
For the demo scenario, see [howToDemo.md](howToDemo.md) <br />


## Suspend / Tear down
```
$ ./down.sh
```
Unfortunately it is (currently) not possible to *suspend* the environment.  <br />
- (One cannot set the number of EKS nodes to 0 and if we top an EKS worker node (EC2) then EKS spins up a new one because we have set a minimum level).  
 
To avoid exessive costs when not using the demo environment, tear-down the environment.  The ./down.sh script will delete the EKS cluster, the EC2 instances, Cloudformation Stacks, Roles, VPCs, Subnets, S3buckets,....  The Cloud9 EC2 instance will stop, but remain available for later.  

To start the enviroment again, simply reconnect to the Cloud9 environment and run **./up.sh**  This will redeploy everything from scratch


## Common issues (WIP)
### Error: Kubernetes cluster unreachable
`The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?`

Verify your AWS_PROJECT variable. It may only contain **lowercase and trailing numbers**, but :
- no uppercase
- no " - "
- no " _ "
- nor any special characters

This variable is used for several purposes and each of them have their own restrictions,..which add up to "only a-z lowercase and numbers"  It may also not begin with a number.

### Error Code: AddressLimitExceeded
![](images/AddressLimitExceeded.png)
<br />
  Ensure that you can create Elastic IPs in this region.  <br />
  By default, there is a (soft) limit of 5 Elastic IPs per AWS region
